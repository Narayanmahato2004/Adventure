                Adventure Time
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
            An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. 
            Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, 
            scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports.
            Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal,
            such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.

                BIKING
            </h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Biking is more than just a mode of transportation; it's a lifestyle
          that brings freedom, excitement, and a closer connection to the
          environment. Riding a bike allows people to explore new places, feel
          the thrill of speed, and appreciate the beauty of nature from a
          different perspective. For many, biking is a way to stay active, boost
          mental well-being, and reduce their carbon footprint. Whether youâ€™re
          cruising through scenic trails, tackling mountain terrain, or
          commuting through city streets, biking offers a sense of adventure and
          empowerment. Plus, it's an activity that can be tailored to any pace,
          making it perfect for everyone from beginners to seasoned cyclists.

                PARAGLIDING
            </h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight,
             free-flying,foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.
             The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing.
              Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, 
              the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, 
              and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

Despite not using an engine, 
paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres,
 though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. 
By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
 often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres

                SURFING
            </h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing),
             uses a board to ride on the forward section,
             or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore.
              Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, 
             but can also be found as standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes,
              in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or wave pools.
